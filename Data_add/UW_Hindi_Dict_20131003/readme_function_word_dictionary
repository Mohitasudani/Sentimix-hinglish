Further explanation:

Essential Dictionaries being made in Hindi, Marathi and English are complementary to the Main or the Content Word Dictionary. An Essential Dictionary is a dictionary of those words that occur frequently in the text of a particular language. This is also called the dictionary of closed category words (a word class to which no new items can normally be added, and that usually contains a relatively small number of items). This dictionary contains broadly two types of words: function words and commonly used symbols, punctuations, word endings, auxiliaries and some common adverbs. Function words contain different types of pronouns (personal, genitive, reflexive, indefinite, reciprocal, interrogative, etc.), conjunctions, interjections, postpositions, case markers, etc. The personal pronouns have been categorized into nominative case, accusative case, dative and genitive case. We are planning to add cardinals and ordinals also into this dictionary.
