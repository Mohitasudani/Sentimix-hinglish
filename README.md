# Sentimix-hinglish
Mixing languages, also known as code- mixing, is a norm in multilingual societies. Multilingual people, who are non-native English speakers, tend to code-mix using English-based phonetic typing and the insertion of anglicisms in their main language. In addition to mixing languages at the sentence level, it is fairly common to find the code-mixing behavior at the word level. This linguistic phenomenon poses a great challenge to conventional NLP systems, which currently rely on monolingual resources to handle the combination of multiple languages.
